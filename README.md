# templates

Short program to show how templates work.

The `lookup` function is taken from Helm library. (Couldn't import for some reason).
It looks like the output of the `lookup` version is verbose. Also, it probably only supports `kubectl get`

TODO:

- Check if there's a function for executing bash commands
